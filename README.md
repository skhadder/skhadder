# 👋 Hi, I’m Sarah
I’m a Computer Science student and aspiring software engineer who enjoys turning ideas into clean, reliable, and user-focused applications. I’m especially interested in building full-stack systems where thoughtful design meets solid engineering—whether that’s structuring databases, designing APIs, or polishing front-end experiences.

I care about writing maintainable code, understanding systems deeply, and continuously improving through collaboration and real-world projects. You’ll find here a mix of academic work, side projects, and experiments as I grow as an engineer.
